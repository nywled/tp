## **Design**

### Architecture

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureDiagram.puml" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete n/David`.

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.puml" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<puml src="diagrams/ComponentManagers.puml" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

<puml src="diagrams/UiClassDiagram.puml" alt="Structure of the UI Component"/>

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

Additionally, the `CommandBox` component will contain a `CommandHistory` component that is used to support the command history feature.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/LogicClassDiagram.puml" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete n/David")` API call as an example.

<puml src="diagrams/DeleteSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</box>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g., to delete a person).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take several interactions (between the comm
2. and object and the `Model`) to achieve.
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<puml src="diagrams/ParserClasses.puml" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<puml src="diagrams/ModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g., the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<puml src="diagrams/BetterModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450" />

</box>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2526S2-CS2103-F08-4/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<puml src="diagrams/StorageClassDiagram.puml" width="700" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefsStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`).
* persists `Event` objects as a top-level list in the address book JSON, identified by a unique integer ID. Each `JsonAdaptedPerson` stores a list of event IDs as foreign keys, which are resolved back into `Event` objects during loading.
* persists the pinned persons list separately within the address book JSON. During loading, pinned entries are resolved against the main persons list to ensure a single source of truth.
* **Note:** CSV import/export (`import`/`export` commands) is handled at the `Logic` layer via `CsvUtil` in `Commons`, and is not part of the `Storage` component.

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### \[Proposed\] Undo/redo feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`. It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedAddressBook#commit()` — Saves the current address book state in its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()` — Restores the previous address book state from its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#redo()` — Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState0.puml" alt="UndoRedoState0" />

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th person in the address book. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book state.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState1.puml" alt="UndoRedoState1" />

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David …​` to add a new person. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState2.puml" alt="UndoRedoState2" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

</box>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState3.puml" alt="UndoRedoState3" />


<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial AddressBook state, then there are no previous AddressBook states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</box>

The following sequence diagram shows how an undo operation goes through the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/UndoSequenceDiagram-Logic.puml" alt="UndoSequenceDiagram-Logic" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</box>

Similarly, how an undo operation goes through the `Model` component is shown below:

<puml src="diagrams/UndoSequenceDiagram-Model.puml" alt="UndoSequenceDiagram-Model" />

The `redo` command does the opposite — it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone AddressBook states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</box>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState4.puml" alt="UndoRedoState4" />

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David …​` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState5.puml" alt="UndoRedoState5" />

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<puml src="diagrams/CommitActivityDiagram.puml" width="250" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
  * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g., for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
  * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

_{more aspects and alternatives to be added}_

### \[Proposed\] Data archiving

_{Explain here how the data archiving feature will be implemented}_

### Retrieval of past entered commands
#### Implementation
The command retrieval mechanism is implemented as a UI-level feature split between `CommandBox` and `CommandHistory`.

`CommandBox` owns a single `CommandHistory` instance for the application's UI session. This instance is responsible for
storing previously entered command strings and handling navigation state (e.g., current history pointer and the user's
latest in-progress input).

This design keeps parser and command execution logic unchanged, since retrieval is triggered by key events in the command input box rather than by a typed command word.

History is non-persistent by design. Command history exists only in memory for the current application run, and is cleared when the application closes.

#### Usage scenario
The interaction flow is as follows:

* User enters a command and presses `Enter`.
  1. `CommandBox` records the command into `CommandHistory`.
      * `CommandHistory` stores all previously entered commands in a list
  2. `CommandBox` executes the command through the existing Logic pipeline.

<puml src="diagrams/CommandHistoryEnterSequenceDiagram.puml" width="250"/>

* When user presses `Up`, `CommandBox` requests an older command from `CommandHistory` and updates the text field.
* When user presses `Down`, `CommandBox` requests a newer command (or restored in-progress input) from
  `CommandHistory` and updates the text field.

<div>
  <puml src="diagrams/CommandHistoryUpSequenceDiagram.puml" width="250"/>
  <puml src="diagrams/CommandHistoryDownSequenceDiagram.puml" width="250"/>
</div>

* Before navigating away, any currently input command by the user is saved as the latest command
* When user manually edits a previous command, `CommandBox` syncs the current text to
  `CommandHistory` as the in-progress input.


#### Design Considerations
**Aspect: Behavior of retrieval and navigation**
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Preserve the in-progress input while navigating history.

  Behavior: If the user has partially typed a command, navigates to older commands using Up, and then returns using Down,
  the original partially typed command is restored.

  * Pros: Intuitive for users who use Up/Down to inspect previous commands without wanting to lose current work.
  * Pros: Reduces accidental loss of in-progress input.
  * Cons: Requires storing one extra temporary input state (the current in-progress command).
* **Alternative 2:** Replace the current input with history entries and do not restore the original partial input.

  Behavior: If the user has partially typed a command and navigates history, editing a recalled command will replace the
  current line; the original partial command is not restored automatically.

  * Pros: Simpler state management and implementation.
  * Pros: Editing recalled history entries is straightforward.
  * Cons: Higher risk of losing in-progress input when browsing history.
  * Cons: Less forgiving for users who use history only for quick reference.

**Aspect: Usage**
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Treat command history as a UI enhancement in `CommandBox`.

  * Pros: Aligns with event-driven Up/Down key handling in the UI layer.
  * Pros: Keeps parser and command execution flow unchanged.
  * Pros: Low implementation complexity and low regression risk.
  * Cons: History is not directly accessible as a typed command (e.g. `history`).
* **Alternative 2:** Implement history as an explicit command in Logic (e.g. `history`, `history 10`).

  * Pros: Can present command history as structured output and potentially support filtering/limits.
  * Pros: Easier to expose to non-UI clients in future.
  * Cons: Adds parser/command/model changes for a feature primarily triggered by keyboard navigation.
  * Cons: Does not by itself provide the same quick Up/Down editing workflow.

Given current goals, Alternative 1 is preferred because the feature focuses on fast command-line input recall rather than
command-output reporting.
### Pin/Unpin contact feature

#### Implementation

The pin/unpin feature is implemented as `PinCommand` and `UnpinCommand`, both implementing `Command`. The feature spans the `Logic`, `Model`, `Storage`, and `UI` components.

The following class diagram shows the main classes involved in the feature:

<puml src="diagrams/PinClassDiagram.puml" alt="PinClassDiagram" width=75% />

`PinCommandParser` and `UnpinCommandParser` each parse the user's input and construct their respective commands with a `PersonInformation` object as the matching criteria. `PinCommand#execute(Model)` resolves the target by finding all matching contacts, filtering out those already pinned, and applying shared disambiguation logic. `UnpinCommand#execute(Model)` mirrors this — it filters to only pinned matches and resolves from those. Both commands throw an error if no match or multiple matches remain.

`AddressBook` maintains two lists: `persons` as the source of truth for all contacts, and `pinnedPersons` as an ordered list of pinned contacts. The insertion order of `pinnedPersons` defines the display order among pinned contacts. The UI reorders the displayed list by sorting against this pinned list, keeping pinned contacts at the top while preserving the relative order of unpinned contacts.

Pinned state is persisted in the JSON save file and reconstructed on load. The UI reflects pin state via a pin indicator shown on each pinned contact's card.

#### Usage scenario

The following sequence diagram shows how a `pin` command flows through the `Logic` component. The `unpin` command follows the same flow, except it filters to only pinned matches and calls `model.unpinPerson(...)` instead.

<puml src="diagrams/PinSequenceDiagram-Logic.puml" alt="PinSequenceDiagram-Logic" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `PinCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of the diagram.

</box>

How the `pinPerson` call is handled inside the `Model` component is shown below:

<puml src="diagrams/PinSequenceDiagram-Model.puml" alt="PinSequenceDiagram-Model" />

The following activity diagram summarizes the command's match-resolution flow:

<puml src="diagrams/PinActivityDiagram.puml" width="600" alt="PinActivityDiagram" />

#### Design considerations

**Aspect: How pinned contacts are represented**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Maintain a separate `pinnedPersons` list in `AddressBook`.
  * Pros: Keeps pin ordering explicit and makes pinned-first sorting straightforward.
  * Pros: Allows pin state to be persisted independently from the main display order.
  * Cons: The model must preserve consistency between `persons` and `pinnedPersons`.

* **Alternative 2:** Store a pinned flag inside each `Person`.
  * Pros: Avoids maintaining a second list for pinned contacts.
  * Cons: Pin order would need extra bookkeeping, and editing a person would mix contact data with UI ordering state.
  * Cons: `isPinned` is not an intrinsic property of a person — it is a feature concern. Placing it on `Person` dilutes the class's responsibility by coupling contact data with application-level behaviour, violating the principle that a `Person` should model a real-world entity rather than a feature's state.

**Aspect: How the displayed list is reordered**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Reorder the UI view using `sortedPersons` and `createPinnedComparator()`.
  * Pros: Keeps the base `persons` list unchanged while still presenting pinned contacts first.
  * Pros: Preserves the relative order of unpinned contacts.
  * Cons: The ordering logic is split between stored pin state and a comparator in `ModelManager`.

* **Alternative 2:** Physically move pinned contacts inside the main person list.
  * Pros: The displayed order would directly match the underlying storage order.
  * Cons: Reordering the main list couples display concerns to storage order and makes non-pin-related operations
    harder to reason about.
  * Cons: Unable to restore order if the pinned contact was unpinned.

### Contact Disambiguating feature

The contact disambiguation feature allows NAB to accurately resolve a target contact when multiple contacts share the same name. This feature is utilized by commands that require precise targeting (e.g., delete, edit) and spans the Logic and Model components.

#### Implementation

The core of this feature relies on the `PersonInformation` class. It encapsulates mandatory fields like `Name` and any optional fields (e.g., phone, email, address, or tags) that can be compared against existing contacts.

The disambiguation logic is driven by `CommandUtil` and `ModelManager`: <br>
* `CommandUtil#targetPerson(Model, PersonInformation)` acts as the orchestrator for the resolution process. This delegates the search and evaluation of `Person` to the methods below.<br><br>
* `ModelManager#findPersons(PersonInformation)` performs the filtering of the address book. It first applies a broad case-insensitive match on the name, followed by an "enriched search" that narrows down the contact candidates by strictly matching any optional fields present in the `PersonInformation` object.<br><br>
* `CommandUtil#targetPersonFromMatches(Model, List<Person>)` evaluates the resulting filtered list. It enforces that exactly one target person is isolated. <br>
  * If the search results in zero matches, it throws a `CommandException`. <br>
  * If it results in multiple ambiguous matches, it updates the UI to display only the conflicting contacts and throws a `CommandException` to prompt the user for better criteria.

#### Usage scenario

The following sequence diagram illustrates the functional path taken when a user executes a command that triggers the disambiguation process.

<puml src="diagrams/DisambiguationSequenceDiagram.puml"/>

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** Due to a PlantUML rendering limitation, the `:XYZCommand` lifeline is shown to prematurely end at the 1st alt path. The unified destroy marker (X) at the bottom represents the termination of the command's lifecycle for all three alternative paths.

</box>                

The following activity diagram summarizes the command's match-resolution flow:

<puml src="diagrams/DisambiguationActivityDiagram.puml"/>

#### Design considerations

**Aspect: How search criteria are passed across architectural boundaries**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Encapsulate all search criteria (Name, Phone, Email, Address, Tag) within a dedicated `PersonInformation` object.
    * Pros: Highly extensible. If a new optional field is added and is considered as a search criterion, the method signatures across `Logic` and `Model` remain unchanged. Only the `PersonInformation` wrapper is updated.
    * Pros: Resolves "Long Parameter List" code smell. Makes method signatures succinct.
    * Cons: Additional overhead from creating and maintaining an additional class.
<br><br>
* **Alternative 2:** Pass individual fields directly as arguments to the utility and model methods.
    * Pros: Does not require creating and maintaining a new class.
    * Cons: Creates method signatures with "Long Parameter List" code smell.
    * Cons: Tight coupling. Any changes to the search criteria (e.g., adding new search criteria,removing search criteria) will require modification to all the method signatures.

### Non-Functional Requirements

###### Portability:
1.  Should work on any _mainstream OS_ as long as it has Java `17` or above installed.
2.  Should be packaged as a single JAR file not exceeding size of 100MB.
3.  Should be fully functional offline and must not depend on any remote server.

###### Scalability:
4.  NAB is intended for single-user use only and does not support multi-user scenarios.

###### Usability:
5.  GUI should work well (i.e. should not cause any resolution-related inconveniences to the user), for standard screen resolutions 1980x1080 and higher, and for screens scaled by 100% to 125%.
6.  GUI should remain usable (i.e. all functions can be used even if the user experieince is not optimal) for resolutions 1280x720 and higher, and for screens scaled by 150%.

###### Performance:
7. NAB should be able to hold up to 1000 persons without a noticeable sluggishness in performance for typical usage.

###### Data Persistence:
8.  The data file should be stored locally in a human-editable text file, allowing advanced users to manipulate data directly by editing the file.

###### Data Synchronization:
9.  All modifications to data should be propogated and reflected in local data storage within 3 seconds.

###### Stability:
10.  All exceptions and errors should be handled gracefully by the application, i.e. there should not be any application crashes.

###### Fault Tolerance:
11.  Should be able to recover at least uncorrupted portions of local storage file or from a backup file should data file be corrupted.

###### Efficiency:
12.  A user with above average typing speed for regular English text (i.e. not code, not system admin commands) should be able to accomplish most of the tasks faster using commands than using the mouse.

###### Response time:
13.  Should not take more than 1 second to process commands and load data for up to 1000 persons and 30 tags cumulative in storage.

###### Data Integrity:
14.  When a contact is deleted, all events linked to that contact should also be removed to prevent orphaned data.

### Glossary

* **NAB**: NUS Address Book, the name of our desktop application.
* **Contacts**: A person (fellow student, friend, classmate, schoolmate) that a user has saved in NAB. A contact is typically (but not necessarily) associated with an event.
* **Tag**: A logical label attached to a contact for association-oriented lookups and logical groupings for easier management.
* **Event**: A contact-linked commitment or arrangement that the user has with one or more contacts (e.g. a project meeting, training session).
* **Unavailability**: A special type of event in NAB to indicate that a contact is unavailable during a time period, used to avoid scheduling conflicts.
* **CLI**: Command Line Interface is a text-based user interface that primarily uses commands and typed-inputs for user interaction (with the application), as opposed to GUI.
* **GUI**: Graphic User Interface is a graphics-based user interface that primarily uses mouse-clicks for user interaction (with the application), as opposed to CLI.
* **Alias**: An alternate name a user can assign to a command that allows easier command execution while maintaining command functionality.
* **CSV**: Comma Separated Values, a plain-text file format used to store tabular data. Specifically, this is to store the application data including contact names, phone numbers, tags, etc.
* **Mainstream OS**: Windows, Linux, Unix, macOS
* **JavaScript Object Notation (JSON)**: A file format used to store and send data in a human-readable format.
* **Java Archive (JAR)**: A file format used to compress multiple Java-related files into a single file for ease of distribution, deployment and execution.
